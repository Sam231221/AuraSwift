# 🔹 Sales Amount vs. Cash Drawer Amount

### 1. **Sales Amount (Total Sales)**

- Represents the **value of all transactions** (cash + card + other methods).
- Example:

  - Cash sales = $500
  - Card sales = $700
  - Refund = $100
  - 👉 Sales = $1,200 – $100 = **$1,100**

This is **revenue-related**, not directly tied to what’s physically in the drawer.

### 2. **Cash Drawer Amount (Till Balance / Expected Cash)**

- Represents the **physical cash in drawer** (float + cash sales – refunds – payouts – deposits).
- Example (with same sales above):

  - Opening float = $200
  - Cash sales = +$500
  - Cash refund = –$100
  - Safe drop = –$50
  - 👉 Drawer = **$550**

This is **asset-related** (actual money on hand).

---

# 🔹 Why They Differ

- Sales include **all payment types**, not just cash.
- Refunds and adjustments reduce sales but also affect drawer differently.
- Non-cash sales (card, mobile pay) never enter the cash drawer.
- Manager payouts (cash taken for expenses) reduce drawer but don’t reduce sales.
- Deposits to the safe/bank reduce drawer but sales remain unchanged.

# 🔹 Quick Comparison

| **Aspect**          | **Sales Amount**                   | **Cash Drawer Amount** |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Basis               | All transactions (cash + non-cash) | Only physical cash     |
| Includes card sales | ✅ Yes                             | ❌ No                  |
| Includes float      | ❌ No                              | ✅ Yes                 |
| Affected by payouts | ❌ No                              | ✅ Yes                 |
| Purpose             | Revenue reporting                  | Cash reconciliation    |

---

✅ **Summary:**
The **sales amount ≠ cash drawer amount**.

- Sales = _all payments (cash + card)_.
- Drawer = _only actual cash in till_.
  They only match if **all sales are cash, no payouts, no deposits, no refunds** — which rarely happens in real retail.

Do you want me to also map out a **formula set** that cashiers/managers use to reconcile sales vs cash drawer at shift close (like the audit equation)?
