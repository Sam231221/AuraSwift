Audit logs in a supermarket Point-of-Sale (POS) system are detailed, chronological records of activities, transactions, and changes that occur within the system. They are essentially a historical "audit trail" used for security, accountability, compliance, and troubleshooting.

The key purpose of these logs is to track **who did what, where, and when**.

For a supermarket POS, these logs typically capture events related to:

### 1. Transactional Activity

These are the most common logs, detailing all sales-related actions:

- **Sales Transactions:** Recording the start and end of a sale, items scanned, quantities, prices, discounts, coupons, and final totals.
- **Tenders/Payments:** The payment method used (cash, card, mobile), amount tendered, and change given.
- **Returns and Voids:** Details of products returned, the reason, the original transaction reference, and who authorized it.
- **Price Overrides:** When a cashier manually changes a price, recording the original price, the new price, and the employee who performed the override (often requiring manager approval).
- **Suspending/Recalling Transactions:** Logging when a transaction is paused and resumed.

### 2. User and System Actions

These logs track the actions of employees and the state of the terminal:

- **Logins and Logouts:** Recording the employee ID, date, and time of signing in and out.
- **Cash Drawer Operations:** Events like **"No Sale"** (opening the drawer without a transaction), cash drops, and cash pickups.
- **System Overrides/Security Events:** Any action requiring a manager's password or key, such as overriding an age restriction or voiding a large transaction.
- **Configuration Changes:** Changes to system settings, like updating a product's price or changing employee permissions.

### 3. Inventory and Stock Control

While often tied to the broader inventory system, the POS logs relevant changes:

- **Inventory Adjustments:** If a cashier or manager adjusts stock levels directly at the terminal (e.g., for damaged goods).
- **Receiving Stock:** Logging when new stock is recorded as received at the store level.

### Why Audit Logs are Crucial for Supermarkets:

- **Fraud Detection and Prevention (Internal and External):** They help managers quickly identify suspicious patterns, such as an employee frequently processing voids, giving unauthorized discounts, or having an excessive number of "No Sale" drawer openings, which can indicate theft or fraud.
- **Accountability:** They pinpoint the exact employee responsible for every action or change made on the system.
- **Financial Reconciliation:** They provide the detailed records needed to balance cash drawers and reconcile daily sales totals with bank deposits.
- **Troubleshooting:** If a system error or discrepancy occurs, the logs help IT staff reconstruct the sequence of events to find the root cause.
- **Compliance:** They provide the documentation required for financial audits and compliance with regulations (like tax reporting).
