```
jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze (${{ matrix.language }})
```

Defines a job called analyze, with a dynamic name based on the language.

```
    runs-on: ${{ (matrix.language == 'swift' && 'macos-latest') || 'ubuntu-latest' }}
```

Runs on macos-latest for Swift, otherwise on ubuntu-latest.

This workflow automatically scans your code for security vulnerabilities using CodeQL whenever you push, open a PR, or on a weekly schedule. It’s set up for JavaScript/TypeScript, checks out your code, initializes CodeQL, and runs the analysis. Results appear in your repo’s Security tab.

Where to See Results:
After the workflow runs, you can view findings at:

Repository → Security tab → Code scanning alerts
Shows specific vulnerabilities with:

1.after defining job name "analyze", there are "name", "runs-on", "permissions". what are these called? are these standard?. does the ordering matter?

These are called job-level keys or job configuration keys in a GitHub Actions workflow. Yes, they are standard and documented in the GitHub Actions syntax.

name: Sets a display name for the job.
runs-on: Specifies the runner (OS/environment) for the job.
permissions: Sets permissions for the job (what it can access).
Ordering does not matter for these keys. You can place them in any order within the job definition, and GitHub Actions will interpret them correctly. The only requirement is that they are inside the job block.

2.so i can place strategy key on the top of name key?
Yes, you can place the strategy key above, below, or anywhere within the job block—before or after name, runs-on, or permissions. The order does not matter; all job-level keys are parsed by GitHub Actions regardless of their position within the job.

3.what is a strategy in the file

In a GitHub Actions workflow, strategy is a key used inside a job to control how that job runs. The most common use is to define a matrix, which lets you run the same job multiple times with different settings (like different languages, OSes, or versions).

In your file, strategy is used to:

Set fail-fast: false (so all matrix jobs run even if one fails)
Define a matrix with different values for language and build-mode
This allows the analyze job to run for each combination in the matrix, making your workflow flexible and scalable for multiple environments or configurations.
