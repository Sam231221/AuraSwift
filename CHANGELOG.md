### BREAKING CHANGE

* **release:** Superseding broken versions v1.17.0-v1.20.2

This release contains the stable v1.16.0 codebase with version number
updated to v1.21.0 to maintain semantic versioning continuity.

Versions v1.17.0 through v1.20.2 contained critical issues and were
never deployed to production. All future development will build on
this v1.21.0 (v1.16.0 codebase).

Changes:
- Updated version from 1.16.0 to 1.21.0
- Added CHANGELOG entry explaining rollback
- No code changes - identical to v1.16.0

Fixes: Critical stability issues in v1.17.0-v1.20.2

# [1.21.0](https://github.com/Sam231221/AuraSwift/compare/v1.16.0...v1.21.0) (2025-12-11)

## ROLLBACK RELEASE

This release restores the stable v1.16.0 codebase and supersedes broken versions v1.17.0 through v1.20.2.

### What Happened?

Versions 1.17.0-1.20.2 were released with critical issues that made them unstable. These versions were never deployed to production users. This release (v1.21.0) contains the exact same stable code as v1.16.0 with proper version numbering to maintain semantic versioning continuity.

### For Developers

- **If you have v1.16.0**: You're on the stable version. Update to v1.21.0 (same code, new version number).
- **If you pulled v1.17.0-v1.20.2**: Update to v1.21.0 immediately.
- **Going forward**: All future development will build on v1.21.0 (v1.16.0 codebase).

### Technical Details

- **Base codebase**: v1.16.0 (2025-12-05)
- **Rolled back versions**: v1.17.0, v1.18.0, v1.19.0, v1.20.0, v1.20.1, v1.20.2
- **Code changes**: None - identical to v1.16.0
- **Version jump**: Necessary to supersede broken releases
