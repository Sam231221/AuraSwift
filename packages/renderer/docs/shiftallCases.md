Here’s a breakdown of **all the shift time cases**:

---

## ✅ Valid Case

- `start_time < end_time`
- Example: Start = 08:00 AM, End = 04:00 PM.
  ➡️ System accepts and saves the shift.

---

## ❌ Invalid / Edge Cases

### 1. **Start Time = End Time**

- Example: Start = 08:00 AM, End = 08:00 AM.
  ➡️ Not a real shift.
  👉 System should reject: _“End time must be later than start time.”_

---

### 2. **End Time Before Start Time (Same Day)**

- Example: Start = 08:00 AM, End = 06:00 AM (same date).
  ➡️ Invalid unless it’s an **overnight shift**.
  👉 If overnight shifts are allowed, system should auto-interpret as:

  - End time = Next day 06:00 AM.
    👉 Otherwise: reject.

---

### 3. **Overnight Shifts (Crossing Midnight)**

- Example: Start = Sept 25, 10:00 PM → End = Sept 26, 06:00 AM.
  ➡️ Valid overnight shift.
  👉 Must ensure date is stored correctly in DB (end date = +1 day if end < start).

---

### 4. **Shift Too Short**

- Example: Start = 08:00 AM, End = 08:10 AM (10 minutes).
  ➡️ Probably input mistake.
  👉 System should warn: _“Shift duration must be at least 1 hour.”_ (configurable).

---

### 5. **Shift Too Long**

- Example: Start = 08:00 AM, End = 08:00 AM next week (7 days).
  ➡️ Likely wrong.
  👉 System should reject or cap max shift length (e.g., 12–16 hours).

---

### 6. **Overlap with Existing Shifts (Same Cashier)**

- Example: Cashier already has a shift 08:00 AM–04:00 PM, user enters another shift 02:00 PM–10:00 PM.
  ➡️ Conflict.
  👉 System should reject: _“Shift overlaps with existing shift.”_

---

### 7. **Backdated Shift**

- Example: Today = Sept 28, but user inputs Sept 25 → Sept 26.
  ➡️ If allowed, it’s for reporting only.
  👉 Many POS systems prevent scheduling shifts in the past, except for managers.

---

### 8. **Future Shift**

- Example: Today = Sept 28, but user inputs Oct 10 → Oct 10.
  ➡️ Valid schedule (staff planning).
  👉 Should be allowed, but cashier won’t be able to _Start Shift_ until that date/time.

---

### 9. **Time Zone Issues**

- Example: Cashier works across daylight saving time changes.
  ➡️ Start = 1:30 AM, End = 2:30 AM, but 2:00 AM doesn’t exist that day.
  👉 Must normalize times to UTC in DB.

---

✅ **Best Practice Rules**

- Enforce: `start_time < end_time` (unless overnight, then add +1 day).
- Enforce: Min/max shift duration.
- Prevent overlapping shifts for the same cashier.
- Allow future scheduling, optionally restrict past.
- Store all times in **UTC** in DB, display in local time.
