# 🔹 Business Logic for Cash Drawer Count (Quick Actions)

## 1. **When to Perform a Cash Drawer Count**

- **Start of Shift (Opening Count)**

  - Cashier (or manager) enters the float (opening balance).
  - System records “expected = X, counted = X.”

- **During Shift (Mid-Shift Count / Blind Count)**

  - Cashier initiates a drawer count.
  - POS temporarily locks transactions.
  - Cashier enters counted denominations.
  - Compare with system’s expected amount.

- **End of Shift (Closing Count)**

  - Mandatory before shift closure.
  - Records actual cash vs expected.
  - Discrepancies logged for audit.

- **Quick/Spot Check (Manager Triggered)**

  - Manager can request surprise count.
  - Ensures cashier accountability during shift.

## 2. **Optimal Data Flow**

1. **Cashier selects “Cash Drawer Count” quick action.**
2. System checks context:

   - If **opening shift** → prompt for opening float.
   - If **mid-shift** → prompt for blind count (no expected total shown).
   - If **closing shift** → force final count.

3. **Cashier enters denominations** (not just total!):

   - Example: `10 x $20, 15 x $10, 22 x $1`.
   - System calculates subtotal.

4. **System compares**:

   - Expected Cash = Transactions recorded – payouts – deposits + opening float.
   - Counted Cash = Cashier input.
   - Difference = Over/Short.

5. **System records**:

   - Shift ID, cashier ID, count type (opening/mid/closing/spot), expected, actual, discrepancy.
   - Requires cashier confirmation (signature/PIN).
   - Optionally requires manager confirmation if discrepancy > threshold.

## 3. **Best Practices**

- **Blind Counts** for mid-shift and closing:

  - Don’t show expected total until cashier confirms their count → prevents manipulation.

- **Denomination Entry** instead of single total:

  - Reduces input mistakes.
  - Helps in audits.

- **Audit Trail**:

  - Every count must store **cashier ID, timestamp, shift ID, count type, counted denominations, discrepancies**.
  - If manager overrides, store manager ID too.

- **Discrepancy Handling**:

  - If discrepancy < threshold → log only.
  - If discrepancy ≥ threshold → require manager approval & explanation.

- **UI/UX Quick Actions**:

  - “Cash Drawer Count” button always visible in quick actions.
  - Use modals with denomination grids (coins & notes).
  - Provide **fast total calculation** while cashier inputs.

## 4. **Algorithm (Pseudocode)**

```python
function performCashDrawerCount(countType, cashierId, shiftId):
    expectedCash = calculateExpectedCash(shiftId)
    countedCash = getDenominationInputFromCashier()

    discrepancy = countedCash - expectedCash

    recordCount({
        shiftId: shiftId,
        cashierId: cashierId,
        countType: countType,
        expected: expectedCash,
        actual: countedCash,
        discrepancy: discrepancy,
        timestamp: now()
    })

    if countType in ["mid-shift", "closing"] and discrepancy != 0:
        if abs(discrepancy) > threshold:
            requireManagerApproval(discrepancy)
        else:
            logDiscrepancy(discrepancy)

    return discrepancy
```

## 5. **Fraud & Efficiency Considerations**

- 🔒 **Security**:

  - Don’t let cashier see expected total before entering their count (blind count).
  - Manager override for high discrepancies.

- ⚡ **Efficiency**:

  - Provide quick denomination entry UI with auto-sum.
  - Allow “Save & Continue Later” if store is busy.

- 📊 **Reports**:

  - End of day reports show over/short per cashier/shift.
  - Helps identify patterns (e.g., cashier consistently short).

---

✅ **Summary**:
The most **optimal, effective, and best-practice business logic** for cash drawer count is:

- **Blind denomination-based counting**,
- **Multiple trigger points (open/mid/close/spot check)**,
- **Strict audit logging**,
- **Manager approval for discrepancies above threshold**,
- **Quick and intuitive denomination-entry UI** for speed and accuracy.
